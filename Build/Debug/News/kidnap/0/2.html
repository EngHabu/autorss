                                                                        (Left to right) Mandy Cool, Charlotte Devaney, Rachel Goodchild                                                      A text message sent by the manager of a group of lapdancers accused of kidnapping a club boss warned the alleged victim would be attacked, a court heard.                  Charlotte Devaney, 34, was  employed to recruit and look after girls working at a pop-up club during the Cheltenham Festival of horse racing.                  But the club was shut down by police for breaching its licence and boss Curtis Woodman was accused of failing to pass on a share of &#xA3;50,000  owed to a number of girls.                  Giving evidence today, Devaney explained that,  although she hadn't been owed any money, she felt it was her role to stand up for the girls.                  Between March and August 2012, she received numerous "harassing" messages from dancers who hadn't been paid, the court heard.                  One message said: "I haven't heard from you in ages. What's happening with the money? I'm starting to get a bit impatient now."                  Devaney told the court: "I was getting harassed, basically, by girls that wanted their money.&#x201D;                  Gary Green, defending Devaney, read out a message sent by the agent in the weeks building up to the alleged kidnap which said Woodman would get attacked.                  Defending the message, Devaney said: "Obviously I'm not proud of those messages. We were just a bunch of angry women with our rolling pins out."                  Devaney is accused of kidnapping Mr Woodman, along with Mandy Cool, 29, Rachel Goodchild, 24, Stephanie Pye, 31, and brothers Robert Morris, 27, and Alexander Morris, 23.                  The women are alleged to have &#x2018;trapped' Mr Woodman in a BMW before driving him to a field where he was beaten up by the Morris brothers.                  He was allegedly threatened with a knife, robbed of his &#xA3;4,650 Breitling watch and forced to transfer &#xA3;4,800 from his bank into Devaney's account.                  Devaney, from London; Pye, from Sutton Coldfield; and Cool,  Goodchild, and brothers Robert and Alexander Norris, all from Southampton,  all deny kidnap.                  The brothers also deny an additional charge of robbery.                  The women were promised &#xA3;150 per day plus 30 per cent commission on all card payments they took while working at the club during the 2012 festival, the court heard.                  Just before it was closed one punter spent almost &#xA3;50,000 on a credit card but the women complained they saw none of it.                  Bristol Crown Court heard how Devaney, Pye, Cool and Goodchild went looking for Mr Woodman six months after the festival.                  Earlier Alexander Morris admitted carrying a bladed article, namely a Stanley knife, on September 3 2012, the day of the alleged kidnap.
