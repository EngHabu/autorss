Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/AAP                                    Former NRL rugby league player Ryan Tandy was allegedly the "hired muscle" in the intimidation and kidnapping of a man, a court has heard.Tandy, from Saratoga, was arrested in Terrigal on the New South Wales central coast last week.The former Bulldogs prop is accused of acting with Simon Daher to kidnap a man over a drug debt worth tens of thousands of dollars on 16 January.Tandy, 32, and Daher, 37, are charged with detaining a person with intent to obtain advantage.Gosford local court heard on Monday that Tandy, at the behest of Daher, went to a central coast sports club and made himself available as a standover man to intimidate a man who allegedly owed Daher money.Tandy and the alleged victim were later filmed on CCTV at the Commonwealth Bank in Gosford.Tandy's lawyer, Manny Conditsis, told the court there had been no reference to his client depriving the alleged victim of his liberty."There is no suggestion Mr Tandy made any threat to the victim," he said.Conditsis said the victim had his mobile phone with him but did not call police or alert bank staff. However, he did send a text message to his sister."If he had been kidnapped, what was she going to do?" Conditsis asked.The case came to a halt when a witness, who Conditsis said was absent from the police facts, stood up and identified herself in the back of the courtroom.The woman shuffled out of court with the prosecution and defence and was interviewed by police for about 45 minutes.The prosecutor told the court the witness was probably worried for her safety for what she told police.The court heard the witness claimed she and the alleged victim had bumped into Tandy and Daher.Conditsis argued that while the witness spent time with the two accused and the alleged victim, she heard nothing "untoward".Magistrate John Chicken said that in light of the material from the new witness, the prosecution case had certainly "taken a hit".Chicken said that, according to the facts, Daher had made the threats of physical harm, including to smash the victim's knees in.Tandy was granted bail with a $2000 surety. He must report daily to Gosford police.&#xA0;Daher did not apply for bail and it was formally refused.The case was adjourned for reply on 11 April.
