His sentencing is May 22.The feds intercepted sick Internet and telephone chats with Meltz while monitoring Michael Van Hise, a New Jersey man accused with Valle in the cop&#x2019;s separate scheme.Last March, a jury found Valle, 29, guilty on several counts and he faces life in prison.Like Valle, Meltz initially claimed his plans were pure fantasy.
