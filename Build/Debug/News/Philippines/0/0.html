Money supply in the Philippines has increased since the central bank phased out its special-deposit accounts last year to curb peso speculation. Philippine bonds, Southeast Asia&#x2019;sbiggest gainers in 2013, are delivering the region&#x2019;s only lossesthis month after inflation accelerated to a two-year high andthe peso slumped. Local-currency government notes dropped 1.1 percent in2014, after gains of 5.2 percent last year that were the bestamong 10 Asian indexes compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc. Consumer-price increases of 4.1 percent are giving investors inPhilippine 10-year securities a real yield of 0.18 percent,compared with 2.3 percent for Thailand and 1.3 percent forMalaysia, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will need to curb money supplybefore raising interest rates from a record low if inflationexceeds 5 percent, and to thwart losses in the peso, accordingto Bank of America Merrill Lynch. A 10.3 percent decline in thecurrency from an almost five-year high in January last year anddevastation caused by Super Typhoon Haiyan are pushing up pricesin the $250 billion economy. &#x201C;We haven&#x2019;t invested in the country for an extended perioddue to the bonds offering very little in terms of yield,&#x201D;Anders Faergemann, a London-based senior fund manager atPineBridge Investments who helps oversee $4.3 billion ofemerging-market debt, said in a Jan. 16 e-mail interview. &#x201C;Weare seeing extensive inflationary pressures building.&#x201D; Spread Widens The yield on the Philippines&#x2019; 10-year government notes hasclimbed 49 basis points, or 0.49 percentage point, to a six-month high of 4.29 percent in 2014, according to data compiledby Bloomberg. Conversely, similar-maturity U.S. Treasury ratesdropped 19 basis points to 2.84 percent even as the FederalReserve started to reduce its debt-buying program in January. Money supply in the Philippines has increased since thecentral bank phased out its special-deposit accounts last yearto curb peso speculation, helping fuel inflation, said Claudio Piron, head of emerging Asia foreign-exchange and fixed-incomestrategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Singapore. Domestic liquidity has expanded more than 30 percent everymonth since July, Bangko Sentral data show, which Piron saidcould push consumer-price gains above the central bank&#x2019;s uppertarget of 5 percent by October. The sell-off in Philippine debt increased the spread overTreasuries by 67 basis points this year to 145, more than doublethe 2013 low of 67, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.That compares with a gap of 560 in Indonesia, whose local-currency notes returned 0.6 percent this year after postinglosses of 13 percent in 2013, the worst among developingnations. Worst Carry Indonesian bonds are providing a real rate of return of0.06 percent, even after accounting for inflation of 8.4 percentin December, the fastest in Southeast Asia. The rupiah is theregion&#x2019;s best-performing currency this year, reverting from thebiggest loss in 2013. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re getting to be more and more concerned about theinflationary expectations&#x201D; in the Philippines, Piron said in aJan. 15 interview. The central bank &#x201C;should increase the carryattraction of the currency,&#x201D; he said. The peso provided the worst carry trades in Asia over thepast month, in which investors source funds in a country withlow borrowing costs and put the money into a nation with higherinterest rates. The peso is underperforming on speculation the monetaryauthority is favoring a weaker currency to revive growth afterTyphoon Haiyan, David Bloom, London-based head of globalforeign-exchange strategy at HSBC, said in a Jan. 17 briefing inSingapore. The central bank isn&#x2019;t targeting any particular leveland will assess the inflation outlook to guide policy, GovernorAmando Tetangco told reporters in Manila the same day. &#x2018;Good Entry&#x2019; &#x201C;Our policy actions are foremost in pursuit of our mandateof keeping prices stable,&#x201D; Tetangco said today in a textmessage to Bloomberg News. &#x201C;Our policy on the FX rate is toessentially allow the market to determine its value, but withscope for official action to contain excessive rate movements.&#x201D; The peso has depreciated 1.5 percent over the past monthand reached 45.19 per dollar in Manila today, the weakest levelsince 2010. The currency may climb 1.6 percent to 44.50 by theend of the second quarter, according to the median estimate of22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg since mid-December. While Bank of America&#x2019;s Piron said sustained weakness inthe peso beyond the 45 level will stoke inflation, PioneerInvestments sees the 45 to 47 range as a &#x201C;good entry&#x201D; point asincreasing remittances from overseas Filipinos support economicexpansion. Money sent home by the approximately 10.5 millionPhilippine nationals working abroad rose 6.1 percent in thefirst 11 months of 2013, exceeding the central bank&#x2019;s 5 percenttarget, official data showed on Jan. 15. December figures aredue on Feb. 17. &#x2018;Strong&#x2019; Remittances The International Monetary Fund predicts the Philippines&#x2019;gross domestic product will increase 6 percent in 2014, slowingfrom 6.8 percent last year, estimates released in October show.That&#x2019;s still faster than the 5.4 percent average forecast forSoutheast Asia&#x2019;s five major economies. &#x201C;We are constructive&#x201D; on the Philippines, Hakan Aksoy, anemerging-markets fund manager in London at Pioneer, whichoversaw 169 billion euros ($229 billion) globally as of end-Sept., said in a Jan. 17 e-mail interview. &#x201C;Remittancescontinue to grow and they still look strong.&#x201D; The Philippines won investment-grade status from Moody&#x2019;sInvestors Service, Standard &amp; Poor&#x2019;s and Fitch Ratings in 2013for the first time as President Benigno Aquino&#x2019;s economicreforms helped spur the fastest expansion in the region. The cost of insuring Philippine government bonds againstnon-payment for five years using credit-default swaps increasedone basis point this year to 115, according to data providerCMA. That compares with 114 for Malaysian debt, 158 forThailand&#x2019;s and 220 for Indonesian securities. No Merit Inflation in the Philippines reached a four-year low of 2.1percent in August before the typhoon struck in November,devastating crops and causing an estimated 571 billion pesos($12.6 billion) in damages, the economic planning agency said inDecember. The central bank forecasts price gains will average4.5 percent in 2014. Bangko Sentral will probably raise its benchmark overnightborrowing rate to 4 percent by the fourth quarter from 3.5percent now, according to the median estimate of 14 analysts ina Bloomberg survey. Mirae Asset Management Co. is underweight in Philippinegovernment bonds, meaning it holds less of the debt than abenchmark index the company follows to track performance. &#x201C;The level of Philippine local yields is still too low toentice investors,&#x201D; Kim Jin Ha, a global fixed-income fundmanager at Mirae Asset in Seoul, which oversees $59 billion,said in a Jan. 16 phone interview. &#x201C;With inflation flirtingaround 4 percent, the real yield doesn&#x2019;t merit buying for now.&#x201D; To contact the reporter on this story:Lilian Karunungan in Singapore at lkarunungan@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story:Sandy Hendry at shendry@bloomberg.net;James Regan at jregan19@bloomberg.net
