Chicago-area couple returns from typhoon-ravaged <b>Philippines</b>.January 20, 2014 (CHICAGO) (WLS) -- More than two months after a deadly typhoon hit the Philippines, residents there are still struggling to rebuild. That message comes from a Chicago-area couple who just returned from the storm-ravaged islands on Monday.   Ray and Leila Villar have been in the Philippines distributing aid. They arrived at O'Hare airport on Monday.     The Villars say typhoon survivors are now battling daily rain and squalid living conditions.   "I said God, how can I help these people because they are coming to us. Can I borrow a hammer, can I have some little nails. So I said, this is the job we have to do," said Leila Villar.   The Villars are the parents of Don Villar, a producer at Eyewitness News.       (Copyright &#xA9;2014 WLS-TV/DT. All Rights Reserved.)Get more Local &#xBB;Tags:local
