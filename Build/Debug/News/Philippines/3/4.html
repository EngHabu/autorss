                                                HUDSON - Pastor Tom Randall is currently being held in a Philippines prison facing allegations of human trafficking.Those close to the Summit County pastor said Randall went to Manila to help with typhoon relief when authorities arrested him on January 12th. Reports said a claim made with Homeland Security and the U.S. Embassy alleged the orphanage network that Randall founded called World Harvest,&#xA0;is actually acting as a front for human trafficking.This accusation comes after authorities investigated one of the orphanages&#x2019; employees for inappropriately interacting with a 15-year-old, a close friend told NewsChannel5.That close friend is Reverend Joe Coffey, with The Christ Community Chapel in Hudson, the same church Randall is affiliated with.Coffey said he&#x2019;s known and worked with Randall for a very long time and doesn&#x2019;t believe these accusations are true.&#x201C;Our prayers that truth and justice will prevail, I mean we want to know what really happened. We want to know the truth, we want to know justice, our prayers are for Tom &#x2026;There is no indication that he has done anything wrong so we just want him released,&#x201D; Coffey said.Coffey and Randall&#x2019;s wife, who is said to currently be in the Philippines, are very concerned for Randall&#x2019;s health.&#xA0; Coffey told NewsChannel5 that Randall is experiencing pneumonia and there&#x2019;s concern he&#x2019;s not getting the proper treatment in jail.&#xA0; Coffey also described around 40 prisoners being held in one jail cell.Reports said a hearing on Randall&#x2019;s release was supposed to be held on Friday. That hearing was delayed.Support for the Hudson pastor is growing online.&#xA0; A &#x201C;Free Tom Randall&#x201D; page already has more than 20 thousand likes on Facebook.
