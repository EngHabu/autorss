Anas loyalist says <b>expulsion</b> is personal, vows to fight.Democratic Party (PD) lawmaker I Gede Pasek Suardika has said he would challenge a decision made by the party&#x2019;s central board last week stripping him of his legislative seat.The PD central board expelled the close friend of former chairman Anas Urbaningrum from the party and recalled him from his position in the House of Representatives for breaching the party&#x2019;s code of ethics and integrity.Pasek said the decision was unreasonable and was motivated by personal vendetta.&#x201C;I was accused of having breached the [party&#x2019;s] code of ethics without explaining which part of it I violated. It turns out that it is actually the party that had violated its own code of ethics,&#x201D; he said on Monday.Pasek said that the official letter to dismiss him was rife with irregularities, which convinced him that the decision was personal in nature.He said the absence of party chairman President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&#x2019;s signature on the letter indicated that the decision against him had not gone through the proper procedure.The letter was only signed by executive chairman Syarief Hasan, who is also the cooperatives and small and medium enterprises minister, and party secretary-general Edhie &#x201C;Ibas&#x201D; Baskoro, Yudhoyono&#x2019;s youngest son.Pasek said that the decision to fire him probably lacked consent from the party&#x2019;s supervisory board as well as its executive board.Due to the irregularities, Pasek said he would file an official complaint.&#x201C;I will first submit complaints to Syarief and Ibas because both of them accused me of ethics violations. And if they refuse to respond to this, I will bring this problem to the court,&#x201D; he said.Pasek said that the PD in recent years had often resorted to heavy-handed measures to curb opposition.He said that many of his colleagues had also been dismissed without compelling reasons. Pasek said he would join forces with other former party members to fight back.Pasek&#x2019;s dismissal was revealed five days after he was seen accompanying Anas to attend a hearing at the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) on Friday, Jan. 10.Pasek&#x2019;s dismissal comes as part of a move to rid Anas&#x2019; loyalists from the party.Late last year, the Democratic Party had removed Pasek from the House&#x2019;s prestigious Commission III, which oversees law and human rights, along with another Anas loyalist, Saan Mustopa, after the two attended the launch of the Indonesian Movement Association (PPI), a mass organization founded by Anas.Contacted separately, House speaker and deputy chairman of the PD&#x2019;s board of patrons Marzuki Alie suggested that Pasek calm down and accept his fate.&#x201C;He might stir up opposition among party members in the region, which will likely put his future legislative campaign in jeopardy,&#x201D; Marzuki said, referring to Pasek&#x2019;s bid to run for the Regional Representative Council (DPD) as a representative of Bali in April&#x2019;s general election.
