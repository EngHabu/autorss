                    Lord Rennard is refusing to apologise over sexual harassment claims [PA]    Indeed, I can imagine it being distressing even being in the same room as this great ermine-coated tub of lard.I find it much easier to imagine what it is like being on the end of a dressing down from Nick Clegg. As Lord Rennard has discovered it must be a bit like being an elephant being squeaked at by a mouse. The Lib Dem leader won&#x2019;t even squeak directly at Lord Rennard; as he admitted on the Today programme yesterday he hasn&#x2019;t spoken to him.He sounded incredulous when it was suggested it might be a good idea when you are a party leader faced with an errant lord to at least have a conversation. In the end it was left to a shadowy body called the Regional Parties Committee to suspend Lord Rennard from party membership.Instead of engaging with the Rennard crisis, Nick Clegg has allowed the issue to drift. He hoped that by referring the matter to a QC he would get a decisive result without having to take sides. Some hope. Instead, the QC concluded that nothing Lord Rennard has done reaches the standard of proof required for a criminal prosecution but that he might instead like to apologise.Lord Rennard not unreasonably concludes that he has been through a quasi-legal process in which guilt was not established and that therefore he is innocent. It would be rather odd for a party professing to be liberal to stage a &#x201C;trial&#x201D;, fail to find the accused guilty and yet punish him even so.A more confident and cunning leader would long ago have seen that Lord Rennard was going to be a poisonous distraction for his party and would have done the modern equivalent of sending him off to govern Bermuda &#x2013; the way Churchill dealt with the Duke of Windsor during the Second World War.He would have found a role which Lord Rennard, in all his pomposity, thought of as a great honour but which, crucially, his detractors viewed as a demotion. That way, everyone would have been happy.Nick Clegg has failed to talk to Lord Rennard face to face over the claims [REUTERS]The Lib Dems&#x2019; little local difficulty is quite fun from the outside but it seems a lot less funny when you start to imagine what it would be like if Clegg were prime minister rather than just deputy. He would then have to deal with far more immovable figures than Lord Rennard. Can you imagine him having to negotiate a treaty with a French president? God forbid he had to lead the country in a crisis against a future Saddam Hussein.But in fairness to Nick Clegg his personal weakness as a party leader is only part of the problem. The rest is the constitution of the Liberal Democrat party. A political party needs to be democratic, of course, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean that it has to be constituted along the lines of a 1970s hippy commune where everyone is encouraged to argue but no-one has decisive power. A properly functioning party holds a democratic election to choose a leader and then lets him, or her, lead.Instead, we were told, the decision of whether or not to suspend Lord Rennard from the Lords rested with the Lib-Dem leader in the Lords &#x2013; whom, it seemed, were minded to ignore Clegg&#x2019;s polite request to suspend Lord Rennard from the Lib Dem group in the House of Lords.But even if they had done as&#xA0;Clegg had asked, the other Lib Dems in the Lords could have overruled them. Then it transpired that because Lord Rennard had chosen to suspend himself he had the power to reinstate himself as well &#x2013; and no-one could stop him. This isn&#x2019;t a political party; it is an Ealing comedy.Even Lord Rennard&#x2019;s expulsion from the Lib Dems by the Regional Parties Committee turns out not to be the final word. Rather it is just the beginning of an investigation &#x2013; which I thought we had just had in the shape of the report by Alistair Webster.Clegg may be officially leader of the Lib Dems but he seems to be the one person who does not now feature in the process. Lib Dem activists seem very excited about their moment in the sun. But it isn&#x2019;t going to impress anyone else. There is a rather better way they could be spending their time and energy: in running the country. For the first time since their minor role in the wartime coalition they find themselves with their hands on at least some of the levers of power.In a very small number of ways they have contributed usefully. Their policy of raising the personal tax threshold to &#xA3;10,000 was eagerly adopted by their Conservative colleagues, many of whom wondered why it hadn&#x2019;t been Conservative policy.But thereafter, the Lib Dems&#x2019; influence on government has been miserable. They expended huge amounts of political capital on a referendum into the single transferable vote &#x2013; an issue which left voters cold compared with the referendum we should really be having, and which the Lib Dems have blocked: on Britain&#x2019;s membership of the EU.The Lib Dems have stared into the headlights of power and been left bewildered. They look tired, bereft of ideas and reduced to squabbling over an internal party issue of zero relevance to the rest of us.Lord Rennard and his accusers have given us some entertainment but it would have been much more appreciated had they been able to offer us some government.
