ShareRead LaterSarah Palin had a Martin Luther King Day message for President Obama, which she posted on her Facebook page after quoting King&#x2019;s famous &#x201C;I Have a Dream&#x201D; speech:It&#x2019;s not the first time the nation&#x2019;s first African-American president has been accused of bringing unnecessary attention to his race, though Palin offered no specific examples of President Obama using the so-called race card.In a recent New Yorker article, President Obama said the opposition his Administration faces could have something to do with his race.&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no doubt that there&#x2019;s some folks who just really dislike me because they don&#x2019;t like the idea of a black President,&#x201D; Obama said. &#x201C;There is a historic connection between some of the arguments that we have politically and the history of race in our country, and sometimes it&#x2019;s hard to disentangle those issues.&#x201D;During President Obama&#x2019;s 2008 presidential campaign, Sen. John McCain&#x2019;s camp said Obama had played the race card and &#x201C;played it from the bottom of the deck&#x201D; during a speech in Missouri during which Obama said the GOP would use the fact that he &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t look like&#xA0;all those other presidents on the dollar bills&#x201D; to keep people from voting for him.
