Citing his own experience as a kid with marijuana, President Barack Obama is weighing in on the legalization debate, saying it isn&#x2019;t more dangerous than alcohol or different from cigarettes.&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think it is more dangerous than alcohol,&#x201D; the president told The New Yorker&#x2019;s David Remnick in a lengthy profile published Sunday.Continue Reading&#x201C;As has been well documented, I smoked pot as a kid, and I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life,&#x201D; Obama said.(PHOTOS: 9 pols who talked pot)However, when pressed whether marijuana is less dangerous than alcohol, Remnick notes that the president, after pausing, said it was &#x201C;in terms of its impact on the individual consumer.&#x201D;Nevertheless, the president said he has warned his daughters of the drug.&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not something I encourage, and I&#x2019;ve told my daughters I think it&#x2019;s a bad idea, a waste of time, not very healthy,&#x201D; the president said.An issue that does concern the president is the incarceration rates of minorities and those in poverty from marijuana.&#x201C;Middle-class kids don&#x2019;t get locked up for smoking pot, and poor kids do,&#x201D; he said.(PHOTOS: Pols who dropped the F-bomb)Obama noted the hypocrisy of individual users receiving long sentences while those who wrote the laws &#x201C;have probably done the same thing.&#x201D;As for the legalization of marijuana in Colorado and Washington state, Obama said, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s important for it to go forward.&#x201D;&#x201C;It&#x2019;s important for society not to have a situation, in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished,&#x201D; the president said.The president did say that those who claim legalization will solve a slew of other problems are &#x201C;overstating the case,&#x201D; and that the new laws in Colorado and Washington state will be a challenge and could lead to tougher debates on harder drugs down the road.&#x201C;You do start getting into some difficult line-drawing issues. If marijuana is fully legalized and at some point folks say, &#x2018;Well, we can come up with a negotiated dose of cocaine that we can show is not any more harmful than vodka,&#x2019; are we open to that? If somebody says, &#x2018;We&#x2019;ve got a finely calibrated dose of meth, it isn&#x2019;t going to kill you or rot your teeth,&#x2019; are we OK with that?&#x201D; the president said.
