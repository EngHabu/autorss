ReasonAdmitted former pot-smoker Barack Obama sayshe doesn&#x2019;t think marijuana is &#x201C;very different&#x201D; from cigarettes(maybe he was doing it wrong, like Bill &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t inhale&#x201D; Clinton),doesn&#x2019;t like that &#x201C;poor kids&#x201D; get locked up for marijuanapossession, and said it was even less dangerous than alcohol. But don&#x2019;t expect his opinions totranslate to policy changes. He&#x2019;s just the president after all.From Slate:The New Yorker&#x2019;s David Remnick&#xA0;hasreleased his long-awaited profile of President Obama and, nosurprises here, it&#x2019;s a long one. Clocking in at almost 17,000words, the piece has several interesting insights, one of whichcomes when Remnick asked the president about the legalization ofmarijuana, and points out that Obama did not seem eager &#x201C;to evolvewith any dispatch and get in front of the issue.&#x201D; But Obama stillsays some things that would have been unthinkable for a presidentonly a few years ago.&#x201C;As has been well documented, I smoked pot as a kid, and I view itas a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettesthat I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adultlife,&#x201D; Obama said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think it is more dangerous thanalcohol.&#x201D; When Remnick pressed on whether marijuana is lessdangerous than alcohol, Obama thought about it for a while and saidit was less dangerous &#x201C;in terms of its impact on the individualconsumer,&#x201D; but emphasized that &#x201C;it&#x2019;s not something I encourage.&#x201D;The president expressed particular concern with thedisproportionate number of arrests for marijuana possession amongminorities. &#x201C;Middle-class kids don&#x2019;t get locked up for smoking pot,and poor kids do,&#x201D; he said, adding that individual users shouldn&#x2019;tbe locked up &#x201C;for long stretches of jail time.&#x201D;Given that Obama says he&#x2019;s quit smoking cigarettes (which arekinda like weed to him) but still drinks socially (which he sayscould be more dangerous than pot) and has previously laughed offthe suggestion that marijuana legalization would be beneficial (andcontinues to head a federal government waging a war on marijuana),his comments shouldn&#x2019;t be interpreted as much more thanoff-the-cuff punditry. &#xA0;Just hope it&#x2019;s not part of theemerging federalmoralism on alcohol use.Read the whole New Yorker profile here.
