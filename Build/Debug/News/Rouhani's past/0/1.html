More Iran Sanctions: Leverage, Or &#x2018;A Path To War&#x2019;?                       As a new nuclear deal goes into effect with Iran, a growing number of US Senators call for still tougher sanctions.

(@dubo1968)From Tom&#x2019;s Reading ListTIME: A New Beginning In Tehran &#x2014; &#x201C;Since President Hassan Rouhani&#x2019;s upset victory in last summer&#x2019;s election, Iran has been consumed with a strategic recalibration. The signing of the short-term nuclear deal in November, which diplomats will spend the next six months trying to turn into an enduring pact, generated tangible change in Iran&#x2019;s relations with the world. And among ordinary Iranians, it&#x2019;s no longer off-limits to talk openly about eventual reconciliation with a country long known as the Great Satan.&#x201D;Haaretz:&#xA0;U.S. Senate sanctions bill is all about torpedoing a nuclear deal with Iran &#x2014; &#x201C;Even if a reasonable time frame were specified, there&#x2019;s a bigger problem. By insisting that Obama certify an end to Iranian missile tests and support for terrorism, Menendez and company are insisting that a final deal cover subjects it was never meant to cover. The interim agreement makes clear that the&#xA0;sole goal of current negotiations&#xA0;is to &#x201C;ensure [that] Iran&#x2019;s nuclear programme will be exclusively peaceful.&#x201D;Washington Post:&#xA0;The U.S. needs a deal with Iran, not detente &#x2013;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x201D;On the surface, the chimera of bringing Iran in from the cold could prove equally alluring. After all, the resurgence of al-Qaeda, a radical Sunni movement, argues for cooperation with an alarmed Shiite state. The United States is seeking to leave its war-torn charge in Afghanistan and may yet need Tehran&#x2019;s assistance for such a withdrawal. Perhaps once the two sides have agreed on the nuclear file, they could move toward a larger canvass of cooperation. &#x201C;
