* Cars, aircraft parts, medicines, consumer goods topshopping list* Payments bottleneck will constrain Western business* Oil majors eager but await full nuclear deal* Vested Iranian interests may block foreign investmentBy Paul TaylorPARIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhaniwill court global business in Davos next week after winning aneasing of some economic sanctions, but any trade bonanza dependson the long-term success of nuclear diplomacy.A U.S. stranglehold on Iran's access to the internationalfinancial system, the uncertain future of talks on its nuclearprogramme beyond a six-month initial deal, and vested interestsin the Islamic Republic suspicious of Western investment allstand in Rouhani's way."I would be surprised if you saw Iran shooting quickly tothe top of the list of attractive markets, although it may beattractive for certain manufactured goods companies in the shortto medium term," said a Western business consultant who workswith many of the world's biggest companies."The fact that Iran is making signals in the right directionis welcome but I think the bulk of business people will becautious and will play a bit of a wait-and-see game," he said,asking - like many involved with Iran - not to be identified dueto the political sensitivities.After a charm offensive at the United Nations in September,the pragmatic Rouhani opens Act Two of Tehran's return to theinternational stage when he addresses the World Economic Forumat the Swiss resort on Thursday, an event that attractspolitical and business leaders from around the world.The White House released a summary on Thursday of lastNovember's interim deal between Iran and six world powers, underwhich Iran agreed to stop production of 20 percent enricheduranium by Jan. 20.In return some sanctions imposed over the nuclear programme- which Western countries suspect is aimed at developing armsdespite Iranian denials - will be relaxed from Monday.In the short term, business opportunities are limited mostlyto areas such as food and consumer goods, medicines, cars andpetrochemicals under the interim accord. Iran will be able tospend $4.2 billion in unfrozen funds over six months, althoughmost sanctions remain pending a long-term agreement.But the potential of a market of 76 million people in acountry with some of the world's biggest oil and gas reserves isa magnet for foreign firms seeking long-term opportunities.Iran has said it wants seven energy companies - Shell, Total, ENI, OMV andStatoil from Europe, as well as U.S. majors Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips - to return.French auto makers Renault and Peugeot attended an automotive conference in Iran already last November,while Iran's ancient airline fleet may one day offeropportunities to Boeing and Airbus.Bijan Khajehpour, a Vienna-based Iranian businessconsultant, said there were the beginnings of a "gold rush" moodin Tehran, with Russia and China racing to pin downoil-for-goods barter deals before Western companies arrive withthe technology that Iran most wants. "We're getting enquiriesnow from a lot of old clients and some new clients," saidKhajehpour, managing partner of Atieh International.Iranian officials want to orchestrate a race between European competitors - and eventually U.S. corporations - forthe best deals. However, most of these can be struck only ifsanctions go altogether under a final settlement."American companies are very eager to enter Iran's market,from car manufacturers to aircraft makers," a senior officialtold Reuters on condition of anonymity. "They are preparing theground for the time when the sanctions are lifted."Among the most promising sectors in the short term areautos, pharmaceuticals, food and consumer goods, Khajehpoursaid, with oil and gas production and technology and aircraftthe biggest longer-term prospects.A spokeswoman for Tehran's Homa hotel, a centre forinternational business, said numbers of European guests hadrisen 30 percent from last year. However, neither the hotel norflights to the capital are full.Trade delegations from Turkey, Georgia, Ireland, Tunisia,Kazakhstan, China, Italy, India, Austria and Sweden have visitedIran since early December, according to Mehrdad Jalalipour,director of Iran's Trade Promotion Organisation.British lawmakers were there this month and a posse ofsenior French industrialists is off to Tehran on Feb. 2-5.MORE ATTRACTIVE TERMS?European oil majors were among the last big Western firms toabandon business with Iran in 2012 and may be among the first toreturn. Sanctions have cut Iran's oil exports by more than halfover the past 18 months to about 1 million barrels a day, andOil Minister Bijan Zanganeh plans an investment conference inLondon later this year, Iranian officials say.Khajehpour said Tehran understood no Western company wouldreturn on the terms imposed in the past, which complied withIran's ban on foreign ownership of its hydrocarbon resources.A government commission reviewing investment terms is due toreport in April, and it was bound to make conditions moreattractive even if they fall short of the production sharingagreements preferred by the oil majors, he said.Germany and Italy were Tehran's two biggest trading partnersbefore the sanctions, selling mostly machinery and chemicals inreturn for oil.Sanctions have impoverished many Iranians. The InternationalMonetary Fund estimates gross domestic product per capita shrankby almost half to $6,500 last year from $12,000 in 2012 on apurchasing power basis.Iranian political analysts say Rouhani needs to create anearly "feel-good factor" from the easing of sanctions to rallypublic and establishment support for a nuclear compromise.Cars may offer a quick win. Iran was one of the world's top10 markets with demand of 1.5 million vehicles a year in 2011before sanctions tightened. That has fallen to about 800,000 butcould rise rapidly, a regional automotive executive said.Renault, Peugeot, Nissan, Suzuki, KIA and Mazda used to supply kits to Iranianpartners who assembled the vehicles. Now Chinese firms havepartly filled the gap, raising their market share from barely 1percent to 5-6 percent, the executive said.European manufacturers' share has fallen from 40 percent toaround 10, he said, requesting anonymity. They are eager toresume supplying kits and parts but a major snag remains."We still have a blockage on financial flows. So nobody ismotivated to send parts and produce there because you are notgoing to be paid," he said, requesting anonymity.The Iranian aviation sector is on its knees, keeping vintageplanes in the air with home-made or cannibalised spare parts,due to U.S. sanctions in force since 1979.Iranian airlines need an estimated 400 new planes,Khajehpour said. For now, they can buy only parts but Boeing andAirbus can cash in, if and when sanctions are fully lifted."NOT OPEN TO BUSINESS"U.S. Treasury Under Secretary David Cohen visited Europethis week to discuss continued enforcement of sanctions thathave largely shut Iran out of the global payments system.A senior U.S. official said Cohen had conveyed a firmmessage. "Iran is not open to business," the official toldreporters. "There are certain openings but they are limited."The message to the business community is that if you thinkwe have removed sanctions, that is a misimpression. Thesanctions regime remains in place," he said.A U.S. official said on Friday the $4.2 billion of Iranianfunds freed up under the interim deal was only a fraction of itstotal frozen foreign exchange assets around the world, which theofficial put at about $100 billion.Western critics of the interim agreement say even limitedtrade openings will ease the pressure on Iran to abandon itssuspected quest for a nuclear weapons capability, and mayinadvertently feed the nuclear supply chain. Tehran insists itsatomic programme is purely for civilian purposes.Emanuele Ottolenghi, senior fellow at the Washington-basedFoundation for the Defence of Democracies, said even apparentlyharmless goods such as dental implants and crowns containedtitanium and beryllium that had nuclear applications.By increasing tenfold to 400,000 euros ($543,800) the sizeof banking transactions exempted from prior authorisation, theEuropean Union would make it easier to sell speciality hi-techequipment to Tehran, he said."I don't mind Italian designers selling high-end shoes andfurniture, or Germans selling fancy bathroom installations, butI'm concerned about the areas chosen for easing sanctions suchas automobiles and petrochemicals which lend themselves to dual(civilian/military) use," Ottolenghi said.As in other countries emerging from sanctions, there will belosers as well as winners, and some prospective losers may seean interest in sabotaging the nuclear negotiations.Hardline clerics close to Iranian Supreme Leader AliKhamenei, Revolutionary Guards commanders and the intelligenceservices have attacked the temporary concessions Rouhani hasmade, although Khamenei has so far backed the president.Some have their own business interests in sanctions-bustingand covert procurement chains for the military and nuclearindustries, and may resist anything more than a limited tradeopening to ease public exasperation with the sanctions."It's not about the national interest but individualinterests," said dissident journalist Nooshabeh Amiri, who fledIran to France in 2005.Among the likely winners are Dubai, long a trade gateway forIran whose rulers have reluctantly complied with the sanctionsto the fury of a powerful merchant class."The partial relaxation of sanctions on Iran is manna forDubai," said Jim Krane, a research fellow at Rice University'sBaker Institute in Houston, Texas. "More than 10,000 Iran-linkedbusinesses operate in Dubai, most of which focus on re-exportinggoods and technology that Iran cannot otherwise get."The relaxation of sanctions may also ease gas exports fromIran, he said. Oman signed a 25-year deal to import Iranian gasbut has been reluctant to follow through for fear of violating atrade deal with the United States. The interim deal might offerthe political cover to start work on a pipeline.However, some Iranian middle-men who thrived under sanctionsare fretting about events since Rouhani won power in June,vowing to improve relations with the outside world.One such is 53-year-old Mohammad, who imports goods fromEurope and the Middle East, helped by his German citizenshipwhile colleagues without foreign passports have struggled. "Twomonths after Rouhani's election, I noticed that the companies Iused to deal with adopted a wait and see policy, hoping to dobusiness directly with the government," he told Reuters."A German businessman from whom I bought second-hand textilemachines told me openly he had approached the (Iranian) embassyto visit Tehran and he prefers to sell the machines to thegovernment directly," he said. "This deal has ruined my positionand my business. Neither side needs me anymore."
