 We havenâ€™t heard much from Dolphins tackle Jonathan Martin since he abruptly left the team on October 28.Â  Apart from a prepared statement read outside the league office after he met with NFL investigator Ted Wells, Martin has said nothing.He also has been silent on Twitter.Â  As several of you have pointed out, Martin has returned to Twitter for the first time since the day he threw down a tray of spaghetti and exited the facility.The message?Â  â€œHappy Holidays!â€œThe responses?Â  Creative, in some instances.Meanwhile, Wells continues his work, largely out of sight.Â  While a second round of interviews with Dolphins linemen was reportedly canceled, a league source tells PFT that Wells intended to conduct the follow-up sessions by phone.Eventually, a report will be delivered to Commissioner Roger Goodell.Â  The report, when finalized, will be made public.Some expect the report to be held until after the Super Bowl.Â  At a minimum, the report wonâ€™t be issued while the Dolphinsâ€™ season continues.Martin has been placed on the teamâ€™s non-football illness list.Â  He has been paid since leaving the team.Â  Guard Richie Incognito remains on paid suspension; through the end of the regular season, Incognito will have been paid for six days.
