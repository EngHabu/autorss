Richie Incognito, an eight-year veteran offensive lineman forthe Miami Dolphins, was accused of harassing and/or bullyingteammate Jonathan Martin, a second-year offensive tackle fromStanford who, by the way, played right next to Incognito on theoffensive line. According to voicemails and text messages releasedto the media, Incognito levied extensive verbal abuse on Martin.The harassment apparently continued over a period of at least a fewmonths. Martin responded to the vitriol by, at first, skippingoff-season workouts, and then, in early November, abruptly leavingthe Dolphins. In short, he preferred to leave his team in themiddle of the NFL season than continue to put up withIncognito's treatment.The Dolphins have indefinitelysuspended&#xA0;Incognito. The NFL has hired outside counsel andis investigating the matter.As a result of the alleged actions by Incognito and Martin'sreaction to these behaviors, a firestorm has engulfed the footballworld and garnered the attention of commentators as well as currentand former football players. (The controversy has also spread toothers in the sports world; shortly after the Incognito storybroke, the NBA issued guidelines on hazing.) Some havecalled for the League to expel Incognito or levy a lifetime ban.Some have said Martin wasn't tough enough and should havehandled the situation "man-to man." Others have defendedIncognito's actions as a rite of passage that Martin, like manyrookie players, had to endure. It's argued that such"trials by fire" build teamwork and serve an essentialpart of the testosterone-driven culture of the NFL.However, that argument falls short when you consider theracially-charged and threatening nature of Incognito'smessages. That part of the incident significantly contributes towhat takes this incident well across the line of acceptable hazing,indoctrination or team building.One issue that remains to be settled is whether Incognito&#x97; who was, unexplainably, a member of the Dolphins'leadership council &#x97; was directed by Dolphin coaches to"toughen up" Martin. We also don't know yet whetherthe coaches or management were aware of the methods Incognito wasemploying to accomplish this task. Furthermore, Martin, through astatement issued by his attorney, has alleged that Incognito didnot act alone, and that other teammates may have also engaged inhazing and possible physical abuse. On the flip side, it has beenalleged that Martin was at times a willing participant in thehazing ritual, and that his treatment was not bullying or unwantedhazing but part of the Dolphins' locker room culture.In the locker room, anything goesLocker rooms, especially male locker rooms (I have never been in afemale one) are very rough places. There are cliques formed byposition, age, college, religion and race. Certain players have anelevated status based on longevity, accomplishment, money, positionor personality. Things that athletes say and do to each other canbe profane, mean, harsh, cryptic and personal. The language, toneand subject matter that can routinely be heard in the locker roomand among players would be unacceptable in any other workplace.When one enters a locker room, he often does so at his ownperil. When I worked for the Philadelphia Eagles as assistant tothe President-General Counsel, I made use of the players'workout facility. This required me to walk through the locker room,a short stroll that subjected me to the unrelenting barbs from thelate-great defensive tackle Jerome Brown.Brown was one of those players with an elevated status &#x97;he was loud, funny, a great player and an important member of theEagles most dominant unit, its defensive line. When Brown would seeme coming through the locker room, he unleashed a blistering verbalbarrage, attacking me for my apparent nerve in coming down from thefront office to enter their domain. He referred to the job I heldas, "the man's penny pincher." Considering that myjob or my ability to be successful in that job did not requireBrown's approval and that we did not have a dependentrelationship, his barbs had little effect on me. However, I stillremember it some 20 years later. The sharpness of his verbalattacks drew great laughter from his teammates. If my relationshipto Brown and those teammates would have been different, hiscomments would have been tough to tolerate.I accepted Brown's behavior at that time because Iunderstood that I was in his locker room sanctuary, and that theaccepted culture of that environment was far different from anyoffice situation I had worked in. In that long-establishedtestosterone culture, language and political correctness take abackseat. The question we now face is whether that longtimetradition relieves a sports organization and its players fromstandard workplace rules. If it doesn't, what are theconsequences of tolerating a potentially "hostile"environment?What's OK in a sports workplace?Workplace harassment has been defined as offensive, belittling orthreatening behavior directed at an individual worker or a group ofworkers. A hostile environment usually requires a pattern ofoffensive conduct. Clearly the admitted behavior of Incognito couldbe categorized as such. But the football world defends this type ofbehavior as normal and unique to its culture. It's this mindsetthat will get sports leagues and organizations into more hot water.These sports entities are not so different and unique that therules of society and the legal obligation of providing a safe andhealthy work environment do not apply to them.Bullying and hazing have been commonplace in sports locker roomsfor decades. From the first real glimpse into the inner working ofpro sports with the books "Paper Lion" or "BallFour" to the glamorized look of HBO's "HardKnocks," we have seen the sometimes juvenile and perhaps cruelactions of our athletes. Whether it is taping a rookie defensiveend to a goal post or dumping a hot-shot running back into a coldtub, the dominance of one group or person over another isunmistakable.Some who are deeply invested in this culture may continue toargue that this type of indoctrination is useful. But Martin'sresponse to his harassment is telling. Rather than confronting hisalleged tormenters, he extricated himself from the environmententirely, a choice that has subjected him to professionalcriticism, public attention and the possible end of his NFLcareer.Next stepsIf Martin's career is over or substantially damaged, does hehave any remedy? Could he sue Incognito for intentional inflictionof emotional distress? Or does he have a claim against the Dolphinsfor the same? Did the Dolphins have some duty to make the workplaceenvironment safe? Given Incognito's history of inappropriatebehavior, is the team subject to some liability for notmonitoring locker room antics or for placing Incognito in aleadership role and failing to monitor him?Authors Brian Crow and Scott Rosner looked at thisquestion&#xA0;in an interesting article on organizationalliability that was written a decade ago for the St. John'sLaw Review. For the article, they reviewed several cases of hazingin university and professional sports where "the injuredemployee alleges that the employer did not exercise due care toprevent the intentional acts of the co-employees."Crow and Rosner cited&#xA0;Stephen J. Beaver's work on workplaceviolence when he noted that in those cases "of managerialnegligence: the plaintiffs allege that the employer should havescreened applicants more scrupulously." This charge ofnegligent hiring could perhaps be made against the Dolphins ifIncognito's "dangerous propensities, unfitness orincompetence were known or should have been" to the Dolphins.(It is noted that Incognito's college and professional athleticcareer was checkered with problems, suspensions, fines, andoff-field allegations that demonstrate a pattern of troublingbehavior and was known to many NFL teams.)As a result of this spotlight, sports organizations are going toquickly realize that they do not operate under a different set ofrules, and the sooner they come to this realization, thebetter.&#xA0;As Boston Globe columnist Christopher Gasperwrote on Nov. 11 when discussing the Incognito bullyingallegations, "The insular and Darwinian culture of the NFLlocker room is not yet ready to join the rest of society in openacknowledgment of the seriousness of bullying" and thatculture seems "more interested in protecting locker roomsanctity." Instead, Gasper writes, the NFL "should beconcerned about is its players creating an environment that isopenly hostile to the next player reporting bullying or harshhazing." Teams "must evolve past the idea that hazing,intimidating, or belittling teammates is a necessary part of NFLteam-building."A more productive strategy would be for teams and the leagues tochange the culture of their locker rooms and to stress to theirworkforce that the behaviors of the past will no longer beacceptable or tolerated. Ben James of Law 360, after talking toseveral employment lawyers,&#xA0;suggested several steps sports organizations couldtake to change their toxic workplace cultures, includingcreating a written policy, articulating the importance ofappropriate and safe workplaces, and putting in place formalprocedures to handle complaints.If the Dolphins had taken these steps, they might not have foundthemselves in this position. They could have created a culturewhere Incognito's boorish ways were not greeted withappreciative laughter or a blind eye. They could have built anorganizational institution where teammates and staff members wereeducated and aware about what is appropriate workplace behavior.They could have created a team where players felt empowered tostand up to so-called bullies.NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell believes strongly in protectingthe NFL shield; the Incognito incident has sullied it quite a bit.As CBS commentator and ex-Steeler head coach Bill Cowher said on"NFL Today," "maybe it's time that we bring athird party into every building, an HR department, where any playeror coach can go to if they feel like the situation is one that theycannot work in." What Cowher did not add, but is critical ifsuch a procedure is to work, is that any HR personnel must have theautonomy and authority to take appropriate action without spurringretaliation by coaches or players against the complaining person.Without such protection, and as the Martin complaint illustrates,such harassing behavior will be kept behind closed doors and sportsorganizations will continue to be confronted by embarrassingincidents.Note: This article did not address in great detail thecomplicating racial component of this workplace incident, whichadds to its explosiveness but is not necessary to evaluate anappropriate workplace environment. It also does not address theeffect that bullying and inappropriate behaviors could have onthose who witness bullying or harassment but are not its directtarget. That analysis is discussed in numerous pieces on hostilework place environments.This article initially appeared in Professional Sports and the Law.Reprinted with permission.The content of this article is intended to provide a generalguide to the subject matter.
