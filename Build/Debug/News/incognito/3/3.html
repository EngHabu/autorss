Team has played admirably but injuries, scandal don't change bottom lineRex Ryan shakes hands with Joe Philbin after the game.  (Jim Rassol, Sun Sentinel )December 23, 2013|By Chris Perkins&#xA0;DAVIE &#x2013; There&#x2019;s a simple explanation for why the Dolphins can win at Pittsburgh, come back home and defeat New England in dramatic fashion, and then follow those victories with a shutout loss at Buffalo.&#xA0;The Dolphins (8-7) aren&#x2019;t a good team.&#xA0;But they&#x2019;re also not a bad team.&#xA0;That puts the Dolphins right where they were when the season started -- at the crossroads of success and disappointment.&#xA0;Make the playoffs and it&#x2019;s a successful season; miss the playoffs and the season is a major disappointment. It&#x2019;s been that way since training camp opened. Nothing has changed from that standpoint.&#xA0;The Dolphins are good enough to make the playoffs, which could/should happen. They might even be good enough to win a playoff game.&#xA0;But they&#x2019;re also capable of losing at home Sunday to the New York Jets in the season finale and missing the playoffs altogether. Or, they could beat the Jets and still miss the playoffs.&#xA0;Any of those scenarios would be understandable. For the most part, you get what you deserve in the NFL. And if you finish 9-7 and miss the playoffs, well, that&#x2019;s probably what should have happened.&#xA0;Look at it this way, if you lose back-to-back to Thad Lewis, Buffalo&#x2019;s quarterback, and Geno Smith, the Jets&#x2019; quarterback, you&#x2019;re probably not a playoff team. (By the way, am I the only one who found it a bit funny that the Dolphins had to beat two hometown kids &#x2013; Lewis attended Hialeah Miami Lakes, Smith attended Miramar &#x2013; to control their playoff future?)&#xA0;The Dolphins have had a tumultuous season, to be sure. They&#x2019;ve lost a starting tight end (Dustin Keller), a starting wide receiver (Brandon Gibson), and a starting cornerback (Dimitri Patterson) to injuries. The Jonathan Martin-Richie Incognito scandal was brutal. At one point the Dolphins were without three starting offensive linemen &#x2013; Martin, Incognito and center Mike Pouncey.&#xA0;Guess what?&#xA0;Nobody cares.&#xA0;Some team goes through major drama or trauma every season. Last year, for example, New Orleans had Bountygate, and Indianapolis lost its coach, Chuck Pagano, for part of the season due to cancer.&#xA0;The Dolphins did well to stick together through the Martin-Incognito situation. It would have torn many teams apart. Coach Joe Philbin and his players should be commended for staying focused and winning during a tough time. But that&#x2019;s where it ends. You don&#x2019;t get rewarded for a good effort, you get rewarded for winning.&#xA0;That&#x2019;s why the Dolphins don&#x2019;t deserve to make the playoffs. If they&#x2019;d have beaten Buffalo and followed that with a victory against the Jets and finished 10-6, they&#x2019;d deserve a playoff berth. Opening the season 3-0, and ending the season 5-0 is pretty strong. But that&#x2019;s not going to happen.&#xA0;So the Dolphins are stuck in this in-between, grayish area.&#xA0;That&#x2019;s the way it is with teams that finish 9-7, 8-8, or 7-9. And that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s most disappointing about the Dolphins.&#xA0;Throughout December, all the way up until Sunday&#x2019;s crushing 19-0 loss at Buffalo, it seemed this year was going to be different. It seemed the Dolphins were going to get out of the 7-9 muck they&#x2019;d been mired in for two of the previous three years.&#xA0;The reality is the Dolphins aren&#x2019;t much different now than they were in 2012.&#xA0;That&#x2019;s a bitter pill to swallow.&#xA0;Despite that, the Dolphins could still make the playoffs, and that&#x2019;d be a major accomplishment.&#xA0;Making the playoffs is the only way this season is a success.&#xA0;Despite the injuries and scandal there&#x2019;s no middle ground after you undertake a two-year makeover that includes the No. 8 pick in the draft (quarterback Ryan Tannehill), the No. 3 pick in the draft (defensive end Dion Jordan), the No. 1 free agent on the market (wide receiver Mike Wallace), and spend hundreds of millions of dollars spent in free agency.&#xA0;Regardless of how the season ends the Dolphins have carried themselves admirably. Philbin has done a nice job, Tannehill is still trending upward. Other players, guys such as rookie left guard Sam Brenner and safety Michael Thomas, have come out of nowhere to do remarkable things. In some ways the Dolphins should be proud of themselves.&#xA0;But the goal since Day One has been to make the playoffs. And if the Dolphins don&#x2019;t accomplish that goal this season has been a major disappointment.
