Miami Dolphins offensive lineman Jonathan Martin was recently added to the nonfootball illness list and teammate Richard Incognito was suspended, officially ending both of their seasons after a scandal involving bullying and hazing.It was reported that Incognito sent many texts and left voice mails for Martin, making threats against he and his family, some allegedly with racial overtones.According to some accounts, Miami head coach Joe Philbin told Incognito to toughen up Martin. This could have gone fine, except Incognito may have gone too far.Although it may be uncomfortable to think about it in a society where football is so popular, the truth is that it&#x92;s a violent sport.Up to 1.5 million young men participate in football annually, and there are an estimated 1.2 million football-related injuries per year, according to the San Francisco Spine Institute. Football by its very nature is violent. There is no reason to assume that this violent nature doesn&#x92;t continue into the locker room as this scandal proves.People may not want to accept it, but football is all about hitting each other as hard as you can on the field. This makes it violent and means that the type of people who play it tend to be more violent than those who don&#x92;t. Violent and mean tendencies usually end on the field, but we shouldn&#x92;t be surprised when they don&#x92;t, like in this case.I believe that this type of incident isn&#x92;t as unusual as we would like to think. Coaches yelling at their players during practice to get them motivated is a very common occurrence. Players who aren&#x92;t putting forth effort get chewed out.Occasionally, however, a player takes this the wrong way, which is what I believe happened in this case. As Incognito admitted in an interview with Fox News, he took it too far. Unfortunately, he didn&#x92;t know that he had crossed the line. He didn&#x92;t want to break Martin. All he wanted was for his team to win.As former Miami player Lydon Murtha put it in an article he wrote for Sports Illustrated, &#x93;Playing football is a man&#x92;s job, and if there&#x92;s any weak link, it gets weeded out. It&#x92;s the leaders&#x92; job on the team to take care of it.&#x94;(Page 2 of 2)The truth is, the NFL is extremely competitive, and any &#x93;weak link&#x94; can bring the entire team down. That&#x92;s probably why coach Philbin told Incognito to toughen Martin up, to see if he was a weak link. In this case, it may have been taken a little too far. Still, Martin didn&#x92;t step up to the challenge, but instead took it public and left the team.In my opinion, this is just a highly publicized case of what happens all the time in locker rooms everywhere. Martin was described by a teammate as &#x93;standoffish and shy to the rest of the offensive linemen.&#x94;It may seem unpleasant, but he may have been the weak link. He wasn&#x92;t bullied and hazed for no reason. In fact, the team may be better off without him, if he really was timid and reserved and wouldn&#x92;t socialize with the other players.I&#x92;m not condoning bullying or racism, but the bottom line is that this isn&#x92;t an isolated case, and the bullying wasn&#x92;t just to bully. It&#x92;s just a case that happened to turn out badly, and a case that was highly publicized.Kye Burchard is a freshman at Great Falls High and a member of the Tribune&#x92;s Teen Panel.
