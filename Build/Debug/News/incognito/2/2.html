Allegations that Miami Dolphins player Jonathan Martin, a 6-foot-5, 300-pound man, was bullied by fellow lineman Richie Incognito, show that no one is immune from workplace bullying.Indeed, 1 out of every 3 employees say they&#x92;ve been bullied at work, according to a survey by the Workplace Bullying Institute. Of these, a third alleges that they suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.A troubling trend, no doubt. Yet here is the first thing you should know about bullying in the workplace: There is no specific law that prohibits it. An employer who is a jerk is not breaking any law. And the same thing might be said for a jerk employee.If a supervisor acts like a jerk and the employee complains about that to company management, management may not do anything about it because there is no specific legal requirement to correct &#x93;jerk-like&#x94; behavior.Are there exceptions? Of course; there are always exceptions. The exceptions in the case of bullying involve those areas of employment that are specifically protected by laws: race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, and a few other categories protected by state law or local ordinance.If employees are discriminated against or harassed by bullying, or by anything else, in ways that involve those specific areas of unlawful discrimination, then that is a violation of the law.But what if your supervisor treats you badly in ways that don&#x92;t involve those specific areas of discrimination? Does the fact that bullying is not specifically a violation of the law mean that there is no recourse?Not always. Here&#x92;s an example.An employee of a Florida company was bullied by his supervisor, who frequently addressed the employee by shouting and using profane language. The employee asked the supervisor to change his behavior, but nothing changed. The worker then complained to the owner of the company, who happened to be the supervisor&#x92;s parent. Again, nothing changed.Finally, after another confrontation, the employee resigned. When the employee applied for unemployment compensation benefits (recently renamed &#x93;re-employment assistance benefits&#x94;), his claim was originally denied because he had left his job voluntarily.(Page 2 of 2)The employee appealed the initial decision, and he won. How could he be awarded unemployment compensation benefits if bullying is not illegal?According to Florida unemployment compensation law, a worker is not entitled to benefits if he or she voluntarily leaves the employment &#x93;without good cause&#x94; attributable to the employer. Good cause, the law says, is something that &#x93;would reasonably impel the average able-bodied qualified worker to give up his or her employment.&#x94;The Workplace Bullying Institute has been pushing to get bullying legislation passed at the state level &#x96; including in Florida. If such legislation is enacted, repeated workplace bullying that result in emotional harm may give rise to legal action. Employees would be able to claim they have been emotionally harmed by co-workers, subordinates, or superiors who engage in verbal abuse, offensive conduct or behavior (including nonverbal behavior) that is threatening, humiliating, or intimidating, or work interference or sabotage which prevents work from getting done.Supervisors who yell at employees, managers who are nice to some but not to all, or supervisors who set impossible deadlines and deprive employees of resources could be causes of company liability.So, even though bullying is not illegal, employers should pay attention to it.Here are some things that employers should do:&#x95;  Adopt policies that encourage employees to report workplace bullying.&#x95;  Train supervisors and managers on how to manage a diverse workforce.&#x95;  Train nonmanagement employees on how to adapt to different management styles.
