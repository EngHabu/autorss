Click here to advertise on CatholicCulture.org  CWN - January 15, 2014                                                     Free eBook: Liturgical Year 2013-2014, Vol. 1            The leader of the Ukrainian Catholic Church has vowed that his clergy will not be deterred by the government&#x2019;s threat to revoke the registration of the Byzantine-rite body.    The Ukrainian Catholic Church (UGCC) has released the full text of a statement by Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, responding to a government complaint that the UGCC clergy had engaged in &#x201C;systematic disregard for the law&#x201D; by participating in demonstrations in Kiev&#x2019;s Independence Square.    Major-Archbishop Shevchuk observed that the government was threatening the activity of the UGCC for &#x201C;the first time Ukraine&#x2019;s independence.&#x201D; He also pointed out that Ukraine is now celebrating the &#x201C;25th anniversary of the legalization of the UGCC in the former Soviet Union.&#x201D;     &#x201C;I hope that the state authorities, especially those entrusted with the task of serving people in guaranteeing their right for religious freedom in Ukraine, will be wise enough not to commence a persecution of the Church,&#x201D; the Ukrainian prelate said.    Many of the faithful had joined in the peaceful demonstrations in Independence Square, expressing their concern about the government&#x2019;s decision to distance Ukraine from the European Union, the UGCC leader said. &#x201C;The presence of the priest there, where his faithful are, is a fundamental part of his pastoral ministry,&#x201D; he insisted. Priests have the right to pray with their people, he said. &#x201C;The realization of such a right does not require the special permission of the state.&#x201D;    An appeal from our founder, Dr. Jeffrey Mirus:        Dear reader: If you found the information on this page helpful in your pursuit of a better Catholic life, please support our work with a donation.
