 Ukrainian Catholic leader Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk (CNS)The head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC), Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk of Kyiv-Halych, has responded to a letter from the government threatening the UGCC with legal action. According to Vatican Radio, the letter was sent in response to the Church&#x2019;s pastoral support for Ukrainians taking part in anti-government demonstrations. In a press conference on Monday, Major Archbishop Shevchuk said that the Church is not directly involved in politics, adding that it will not refuse when its faithful ask for spiritual help. &#x201C;Our church has always been true to this mission that Christ entrusted to our Church,&#x201D; the Major Archbishop said, &#x201C;and will remain so for the future and despite any threats.&#x201D; In the letter, sent by the Ministry of Culture, the behaviour of UGCC priests in Kiev&#x2019;s Independence Square, where protests have been taking place since December, was described as &#x201C;a violation of Ukrainian legislation regarding the freedom of conscience and religious meetings,&#x201D; which could lead to &#x201C;the cancellation of the Church&#x2019;s activities&#x201D; and criminal charges.
