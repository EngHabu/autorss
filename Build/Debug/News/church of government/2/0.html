The ministry of culture cited &#x201C;systematic disregard for the law by some priests&#x201D; at the anti-government Euromaidan protests that began in November.    Although the Church does not take part in political events, it &#x201C;cannot stay apart when faithful ask for spiritual care,&#x201D; said Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, who leads the church, which is the largest of the Eastern Catholic churches.    &#x201C;Our Church has always been true and will remain so for the future mission that Christ the Savior entrusted, despite all the threats,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;We thought that the time of repression has passed, but letters like these give doubts. We are not ashamed of our presence on the Maidan and will remain there.&#x201D;   An appeal from our founder, Dr. Jeffrey Mirus:        Dear reader: If you found the information on this page helpful in your pursuit of a better Catholic life, please support our work with a donation.
